# Overthewire
## Why am i doing this?

Im trying to learn ethical hacking for free so im constantly looking around trying to find new ways to learn and told asked myself, why not go through all the overthewire games and write a writeup for them? theres literally no point in doing so.


so i'm doing it.


this should be finished by the january unless i decide i'm done with overthewire.
