Goal: `The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.` 

Solution: 

```sh
 cd inhere
```
See hidden files with :
```sh
ls -la 
```
And print them like:

```sh 
cat .hidden
```

We use a dot before the filename to print hidden files/enter hidden directories.
